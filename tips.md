Professor Howard Stevenson’s Secret Sauce of Entrepreneurship (Tip 1)

1. A careful definition of available opportunities: Is there a demand out there that’s not being recognized or addressed, and what product or service can I offer that meets it?

2. The motivation to pursue those opportunities to achieve some desired future state: Do I have the long-term will and endurance necessary to stick with it, until that product or service is fully implemented and available?

3. An understanding of the resource requirements for achievement of that desired future state: Do I fully comprehend what human, financial, material , and other assets that I need?  Is it feasible for me to launch, and succeed with, that product or service?

4. A skill in negotiating for access to the required resources:  Even if I don’t possess all the assets I need, can I get other people to believe in and contribute to the opportunity to the extent that success can be achieved?
