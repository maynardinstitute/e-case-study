THE SITUATION

As  8 p.m. approached at the MainStreetCitizen.com, Beverly Blaser, the site’s founder, president and editor reflected on her long day’s work.  

Beverly had been busy throughout the day working almost non-stop on her start-up news-oriented web site dedicated to covering her local neighborhoods surrounding the multi-cultural college community of Lincoln Park. After tweeting the site’s morning news stories at 6 a.m. prior to breakfast and then dropping off her daughter at junior high school, Beverly’s 12-hour day went like this:

At 8 a.m., she appeared at a local Chamber of Commerce breakfast to meet the city’s business and political leaders as a way to network and build awareness for the Main Street Citizen.

At 10 a.m., she called one of her part-time writers, Nancy Matsuda,   to discuss which three local news stories would be covered and posted later that day for the evening news cycle. Blaser also planned to tweet the afternoon stories on the site’s Twitter account and Facebook page by the start of the evening rush hour. 

At 11 a.m., she had a meeting with her contractor web designer to go over a prototype of an online advertising kit. 

At noon, she had a lunch meeting with a prospective “angel” investor to report on the site’s progress.  

At 2 p.m., she had returned to the her home office to help edit the local news stories that would be posted that afternoon and check with her other part-time writer, Evelyn Hernandez, on which stories would be posted for the next day for the morning news cycle.

At 3 p.m., she called the part-time bookkeeper to review the financial results from the prior month and then picked her daughter up from high school.

At 4 p.m., she interviewed a candidate for a part-time office manager position. Beverly had discovered that in addition to spending much her time overseeing the two part-time reporters and posting and tweeting of stories, much time was being spent on mundane administrative chores, such as running errands to buy supplies,  scheduling meetings, and photocopying reports. A part-time office manager might keep her better organized, field phone calls from the public,  and make the running of the office more efficient. Beverly estimated that a hiring a part-time manager would free up about 10 to 15 hours of her time per week, but she had been reluctant to add the expense.   

At 5 p.m., she then then tweeted the evening news stories and then worked on an e-mail blast to be sent out the next morning and on a several early stories that would be posted. 

The balance of the day was then spent responding to e-mails, sending inquiries to her small staff, and paying various bills.


As Beverly prepared to finish her work at 8 p.m. to have a late evening with her husband and daughter, she was wondering whether all the effort to make the MainStreetCitizen.com work was worth it.   

Two years earlier, Beverly had been the managing editor at The Gazette, the town’s local newspaper with a daily circulation of 40,000 and a Sunday circulation of 35,000, and overseeing a newsroom staff of 35.  After taking a voluntary buy-out to leave the newspaper – after becoming discouraged with several rounds of cutbacks -- Beverly subsequently decided to launch the MainStreetCitizen.com, following The Gazette’s decision to eliminate all of their  weekly Friday zoned sections in a cost-saving move dictated by the newspaper’s out-of-town  parent company, Mirror-Times.  Believing that the elimination of The Gazette’s  zoned section had left her Lincoln Park area of the town – which included the local university -- without any  regular news coverage,  Beverly determined that there was an opportunity ([Lincoln Park Demographics](../e-case-study/lincoln_park_demographics.md)).  After briefly considering a launch of a weekly neighborhood tabloid newspaper, Beverly opted instead to pursue a neighborhood web site instead, noting that an online platform would provide more news on a daily basis, allow direct feedback from visitors, and avoid the expenses of printing and delivering a printed product.

In addition, with the proliferation of tablets, smart phones and social media,  Beverly sensed that many of the targeted readers in her area of town  -- especially the students and faculty at the local university --  were beginning to consume more of their news on digital platforms.  

Working with an MBA student from the local university, Beverly put together a simple but somewhat optimistic plan that allowed her to determine her projected revenue and expenses over the first three years and when it would break-even.  Beverly also tried to measure the risks of the start-up, by preparing a worst case financial scenario on how much it could possibly lose.
