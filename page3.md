Beverly’s initial goal was to use the seed money to get the MainStreetCitizen.com going over the first 12 months before deciding  what to do next.  Despite the initial hiring of part-time staff, Beverly knew that additional capital would be needed to redesign the site to make its navigation easier and to add 3 part-time members to post calendar events, manage social media and mobile content, and to be an office manager.  

Though unbudgeted, a part-time copy editor was added, after initial complaints from the public of stories with grammatical and factual errors being posted.  Being an editor, Beverly quickly realized the importance of having a copy editor to maintain the site’s journalistic credibility.

The initial seed money, however,  was drying up and Beverly’s bookkeeper that afternoon informed her that there would only be three more months of funding left before the cash ran out.  Not wishing to run out of cash, be left in a potentially financially embarrassing situation or take on any additional debt, a call to Beverly’s CPA told her that there would be four options ([WSJ article: Why Business Plans Don't Deliver](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204830304574133501980701202)):

1. Borrow more.

2. Sell equity in the company or partner up with another entity.

3. Sell the MainStreetCitizen.com to another entity.

4. Change the MainStreetCitizen.com’s business model so that it would generate more revenue faster.

([List of the pros and cons of each option and analysis](/pros_cons.md))

In the short-term, Beverly wondered how the MainSteetCitizen.com could generate more revenue. While the online advertising revenue had been modest – bringing in about $20,000 annually – and page views and unique visitors growing steadily, but slower than expected, she was exploring other revenue-generating sources that have benefitted other neighborhood sites like hers, such as holding a series of events featuring well-known speakers from the Lincoln Park community or having sponsored-sections of the site.  

A more radical change – as noted in the fourth option above – might be to make a “pivotal change” in the MainStreetCitizen.com’s business model for an entirely neighborhood news and feature site to a combination news and blog site, similar to a mini-Huffington Post.  By having regular contributors blog about Lincoln Park, the MainStreetCitizen.com can generate additional content and page views at relatively low cost and more quickly increase revenue.

In addition to her cash concerns, Beverly had also learned at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting that morning that three new external threats may emerge shortly:

First, The Gazette is considering launching a hyper-local online news site in the area that the Main Street Citizen.com is covering, utilizing journalism students from the local University to cover the news.  The site would be managed by one of The Gazette’s deputy city editors, who also lived in Beverly’s neighborhood.

Second, one of the journalism school professors at the local university is considering the launch of a similar hyper-local news site, but to establish it as a non-profit, where funding would come from a well-known, well-endowed local foundation and there would be a smaller need to show any financial return.

Third, the corporate media giant AOL was rumored to launch a Patch site for the Lincoln Park community.

Faced with these challenges, Beverly wondered what she should do next and which option she should pursue. What will she say to her family and friends about the current financial situation?  What adjustments would she have to make to reallocate her resources so that TheMainStreetCitizen.com could run more efficiently? And how much more money would that take to get “Plan B’ up and running?   From whom should she seek advice from? Maybe she should have stayed at The Gazette instead ([Top ten reasons why small businesses fail  - NYTimes Blog](https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/top-10-reasons-small-businesses-fail/)).
