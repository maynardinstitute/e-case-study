Now in its fourteenth month since launch, the MainStreetCitizen.com had gradually grown to 40,000 page views per day, with 15,000 unique users per month, and the average time spent on the site being about 10 minutes per day (key metrics for the MainStreetCitizen.com).  As a news site, the MainStreetCitizen.com was recognized by a regional group of professional journalists as the best local news site and it had just won a first-place award for a breaking news story about the local university partnering with a California-based biotech company to create a new research center that could potentially add 300 new jobs for the town.  This was a news story The Gazette had missed entirely and did not report on until after the local university held an official press conference to announce the partnership three days later.

Despite the kudos and awards, Beverly knew keeping the site was not without its challenges.

The MainStreetCitizen.com team consisted of Beverly, a part-time copy editor, two part-time reporters and a part-time web designer.

In addition, there was a part time bookkeeper who handled the start-ups bank statements and tax filings (list of tax and business filings for a small start-up) and a commission-only sales representative who sold online advertisement and sponsorships for the site. While Beverly did not take a paid salary, the two part time reporters did, and the other members of her staff were paid contractors. Payroll consisted of a large portion of the start-up’s overall expenses (annual profit & loss statement).  

Since starting up, Beverly had discovered that hiring and training people took up a majority of her time – especially aligning them with her vision of what The MainStreetCitizen.com should be.  

There was much turnover in filling the two part-time reporter positions as well.  The first several reporters hired, Beverly thought, were too inexperienced and she had to spend time helping them with their copy. Some were replaced.  Others quit after a few weeks to take better-paying jobs elsewhere as Beverly did not offer the typical benefits found in larger companies, such as vacation or health insurance. Since then, The MainStreetCitizen.com had hired two reporters with one or two years of experience with other local newspapers.  As an entrepreneur, Beverly quickly discovered that she had to replace staff that was not working out – something that she did not have to do at The Gazette, where underperformers could often be moved elsewhere. (Dickson Louie’s key question, Tip 4 and Bruce B. Brugmann on managing human resources, Tip 5).

Finding the right financial manager was also a challenge.  Initially, to help her understand the mountain of required business and tax filings, she had hired a local CPA, but then went to a local bookkeeper instead who charged her lower rates on more routine financial matters (she still retained the CPA for more sophisticated tax questions).  (How to hire the right accountant - NYTimes, Small Business Article).   Still, Beverly had lots to learn, especially understanding the differences between the various federal and state tax statements and the three basic financial reports: profit-and-loss statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

Managing the staff, fielding phone calls from the public, fulfilling regulatory requirements and producing an online product several times a day, often left Beverly time-stressed.  Much of her time was spent being reactive to unforeseen problems instead of being proactive in seeking new opportunities, such as new revenue streams or new products (Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos on time management, Tip 6).   In looking back at the initial business plan, Beverly realized that many unexpected issues, such as having to replace the initial part-time reporters or unforeseen expenses, were never anticipated (General Dwight D. Eisenhower on initial plans, Tip 7).

To fund the start-up, Beverly had borrowed $70,000 in initial seed money (breakdown of seed money) from her family and friends, including a $10,000 equity loan that she and her husband took out against her house. Beverly did not take a salary herself, having received a severance package from The Gazette a year earlier, but that financial cushion was   now running thin and a personal concern to her and her husband.  To save on overhead costs and avoid any rental expense for office space, Beverly had worked out of her home office while her reporters,  copy editor, web designer, and sales person worked out of their homes too.  They were connected virtually by e-mail, text or phone.  (Robin Wolaner on entrepreneurs questioning their motives, Tip 8).
